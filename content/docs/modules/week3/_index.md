### Start to see the bigger picture

We have prepared some reading material that will help you to understand the "bigger picture" of what you'll accomplish in the remaining weeks.

_Optional_:
- [Modified principles for Code and Data (optional)](https://www.shirokuriwaki.com/programming/project-organization.html)
- [Principles of Workflow Management (optional)](http://tilburgsciencehub.com/tutorials/project-setup/principles-of-project-setup-and-workflow-management/overview/)

### Catching up with tutorials
If you haven't been able to work through all tutorials yet, it's also wise to keep on investing in your skills.

If you're done, start working through the tutorials of subsequent weeks to help you balance the course workload with demands from other courses.
