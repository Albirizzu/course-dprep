# Modules

The course consists of weekly modules. The first five weeks (including one self-study week) equip you with the skills to work on data-intensive research projects efficiently. The modules are structured along the different stages of an empirical research project.

The remaining three weeks are dedicated to working on a team project, in which you put your skills into practice.
