# Team Project

## Motivation

Throughout the course, we have touched upon various phases of the data preparation and workflow management pipeline. In the team project, we bring together all that you have learnt.

Together with your team members, you will
- build a data preparation and analysis pipeline from scratch, and
- submit your entire end-to-end workflow via a GitHub repository.

Working on your team project is not only a great refresher on the course content, but *especially* gives you a better sense of the added value of
- using Git/GitHub when collaborating with one another, and
- automation with `make` with a many source code files.

In addition, the building blocks provide code snippets for more advanced functionalities you may want to incorporate in your team project.

## Learning Goals

After completion of the project, students and researchers need to be equipped with the practical skills to manage the data preparation for a complex, data-intensive research project independently.

## Teams

- Students work in groups
  - 4-5 students per team
  - Allocation during class hours

- Three types of teams
  - __(1) Regular teams__ (by default) work with data from [AirBnB](airbnb.md)
  - __(2) Students that are taking ["Online Data Collection and Management" (oDCM)](https://odcm.hannesdatta.com)__ can use the collected raw data from that course.
      - The submission (one for each course) consist of
          - your data collection, the raw data, and its documentation (focus of oDCM), and
          - the entire project pipeline (focus of dPrep, consisting of data exploration, data preparation, automation and deployment).
      - Start your workflow from the data package template.
      - Make sure that you have collected (at least) some raw data by week 5/6 in oDCM, so that you can start your team project here in dPrep.
  - __(3) (External) PhD and research master students__ auditing this course can work on their own research projects.


## Deadline & Submission
- Originally 26 March 2021, 6pm; extended to 2 April 2021, 6pm.
- Please submit links to your GitHub repository with the necessary source code (one link per team).

{{< hint info>}}
__Where do I submit my report?__

Gotcha! There is no report! The project should self-document itself (e.g., comments in code, `makefile`), plus you'll have an amazing README that ties everything together and motivates your project. Make this one shine! :)

Note that we will check out the state of the repository __at the deadline date and time__, so any changes you make to the repository *afterwards* are not considered for grading.

## Getting started

The coaching for your team project takes place in weeks 6-8. You are free to form teams before that (teams will be finalized in week 5).

<!--
You can sign up for optional team meetings with the course instructor in weeks 6-8 to gather feedback on your project. Details on how to register for a time slot will be provided to you at a later stage.
