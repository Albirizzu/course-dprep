# Tutorial: R Bootcamp

Datasets have become massive and demands for tools that can handle such data have increased. R provides you with a toolbox to handle and analyze large data sets. As such, it's not surprising R skills have become mandatory for any job  related to marketing analytics or data science.

The best thing about R is that it's open source. It's freely usuable by anyone. Plus there's a vibrant community that keeps on developing R. Or extend it with your own packages.

## Learning goals

* Setup R and R Studio
* Familiarize yourself with the basics in R
<!--  * Read data from text files into data frames in R
  * Create and handle various data types in R (e.g., vector, matrix, dataframe)
  * Change the content of data frames (e.g., create, drop, or rename columns)
  * Filter data in data frames (e.g., by index, logical expressions, missing records, etc.)
  * Apply basic programming concepts (if-else statements, for-loop, functions )
-->
## Make a plan
- If you're an absolute novice to R, working through the setup instructions and obtaining a basic skill level in R entails a significant time investment. Plan about four to six hours to work on this.
