## Engineer data sets and manage research projects efficiently

Welcome to the course website of dPrep!

This course teaches you how to __efficiently manage empirical (marketing) research projects__. Many students and researchers perceive the process of doing research as rather simplistic: a bit of data cleaning here and analysis there, and you're done. In this course, you will __professionalize your way-of-working__. In particular, this course zooms in on __highly complex, reproducible data preparation workflows__ (think of complex structured and unstructured raw data, derived from multiple sources, provided in multiple delivery batches, with lots of missing data, etc.). Throughout the course, you'll be using workflow principles of __reproducible science__ that are documented at [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com).

The course offers seats to Research Master and PhD students from outside of Tilburg University.

## This website

This website is the backbone of the course, and features the following main sections.

- The [__course__](docs/course) section features the syllabus, schedule, and grading details.

- The __[weekly modules](docs/modules)__ consist of live streams, readings, and prerecorded clips. Even if you're not enrolled in this course, you can watch these clips, but interaction with the course instructor is reserved for enrolled students only.

- The [__tutorial and data challenge__](docs/tutorials) section offers self-guided tutorials that teach the *principles* of data preparation and workflow management. It also holds a (weekly) data challenge in which you can put your skills into practice. <!--Use these to start your own empirical research projects! <!--a workflow for collecting online data, and -->

- Finally, this course uses building blocks and examples from [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com), a platform to help students, researchers and data scientists to work together efficiently.

<!--- Finally, the [__building block__](docs/snippets) section offers a collection of code snippets in Python that you can use to build and extend your own scrapers and API retrieval projects.
